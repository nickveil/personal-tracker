# Tracker

---

A web application to track anything. Tracker allows a user to track their habits or other items by collecting user input. Users can then navigate to a static page.

## Technologies used
1. Laravel 5.4
2. Vue.js
3. PSequel
4. Github repo
5. Heroku deployment
6. D3js

## User Stories

---

1. As a user I want to increment a counter so that I can count the number of time I conduct a particular habit throughout the day.

2. As a user I want to have the ability to look at the history of the items I am tracking so that I can see potential trends visually.

3. As a user I want to select multiple items tracked for display on a defined timeline so that I can look for possible interactions between multiple habits.


## MVP
---

[X] 1. Create one user to begin

			[X]	- Create one user for login and assign data

							[ ] 2. Increment arrow
							[ ] 3. Decrement arrow
							[ ] 4. Last update indicator

							[ ] 6. Title block

			[ ] - Track 2 -- Hours of Sleep
						- Display should include

[ ] 4. Login in as user and navigate to the data

[ ] 5. Have a display page that shows previous days totals

## Stretch Goals
